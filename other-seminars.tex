\paragraph*{Other seminars, workshops, and projects.}
We are aware of the following recent events connected to the topic of the proposed seminar.
\begin{itemize}
\item A workshop on structural sparsity, logic, and algorithms was organized by Anuj Dawar, Zdenek Dvo\v{r}\'ak, and Daniel Kr\'al' at the University of Warwick in June 2018. 
It was a follow-up of a workshop on similar topics organized at the same place in December 2016 by Daniel Kr\'al' and Ranko Lazi\'c. See \url{https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/daniel_kral/strlogalg/}
and \url{https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/daniel_kral/alglogstr}.
\item In Autumn 2018, Charles University in Prague is organizing DOCCOURSE: a 1.5-month long program on structural sparsity in connection with model theory
for senior undergraduate and graduate students. See \url{https://iuuk.mff.cuni.cz/events/doccourse2018/}.
\item A one-day satellite workshop on algorithms and structure for sparse graphs was organized during the 44th International Colloquium on Automata, Languages, and Programming, ICALP 2017, held in Warsaw in July 2017.
\item TODO: Paris event
\end{itemize}
We are not aware of any previous Dagstuhl seminars directly overlapping with the subject of our proposal.
