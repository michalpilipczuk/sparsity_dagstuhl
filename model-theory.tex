\paragraph*{Model theory.}
The connections between structural and algorithmic properties of sparse classes of graphs --- notably nowhere dense classes --- and the model-theoretical notions of independence and stability have deep, as witnessed in particular by two fundamental results. The first result asserts that for a monotone class of graphs, the notions of nowhere dense class, NIP class, and stable class are equivalent \cite{adler2014interpreting}. The second one states that nowhere dense classes are the most general monotone classes for which first-order model checking is fixed-parameter tractable \cite{grohe2017deciding}. This connection has already proved his efficiency in transferring techniques and notions from model theory to combinatorics (see for instance \cite{pilipczuk2018number}) and, conversely, from combinatorics to finite model theory (see for instance \cite{rossman2008homomorphism}).
