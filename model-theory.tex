\paragraph*{Model theory.}
The  structural and algorithmic properties of sparse classes of graphs --- notably nowhere dense classes --- are deeply connected to  the model-theoretical notions of independence and stability, as witnessed in particular by two fundamental results. The first result asserts that for a monotone class of graphs, the notions of nowhere dense class, NIP class, and stable class are equivalent \cite{adler2014interpreting}. The second one states that nowhere dense classes are the most general monotone classes for which first-order model checking is fixed-parameter tractable \cite{grohe2017deciding}. This connection has already proved his efficiency in transferring techniques and notions from model theory to combinatorics (see for instance \cite{pilipczuk2018number}) and, conversely, from combinatorics to finite model theory (see for instance \cite{rossman2008homomorphism}).

Guided by the model theoretical intuition, it is natural to expect that some of the techniques and results proved for monotone sparse classes may extend to hereditary structurally sparse classes, that is possibly dense classes of low structural complexity. In this direction, it has been proved that model checking is fixed parameter tractable on interpretations of classes of graphs with bounded maximum degree \cite{gajarsky2016new} and that transductions of bounded expansion classes of graphs admit low shrub-depth decompositions, a dense analog of low tree-depth decompositions \cite{gajarsky2018first}.
