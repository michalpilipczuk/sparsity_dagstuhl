\begin{abstract}
The concept of \emph{sparsity} in combinatorics
aims at capturing abstract notions of uniform sparsity of graphs,
as well as more general relational structures.
The main goal is to obtain understanding why, and to what extent,
structural properties related to the sparsity of a given structure
can be used to develop sparsity-based methods and algorithms.
Since the pioneering work of Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il and Ossona de Mendez from the late 2000's,
a huge body of research has shown that the two main sparsity concepts --- \emph{bounded expansion} and \emph{nowhere denseness} ---
have deep connections to classic notions from algorithm design, combinatorics and model theory, and
they can be used to obtain powerful structural and algorithmic results.
It is the synergy of algorithm design, combinatorics and model theory that
makes studying sparsity mathematically exciting and brings so many computer science applications.
One of the many evidences of the fundamental nature of the concepts of bounded expansion and nowhere denseness is that
these two concepts constitute the boundary of the computational tractability for many natural classes of problems, 
most notably first-order model checking.

The aim of the proposed seminar is to bring together researchers working on various aspects of sparsity in their own fields,
in order to facilitate the exchange of ideas, methods and questions between different communities.
An important part of the seminar will be the discussion of the (still fledgling) area of real-life applications of
sparsity-based methods, where theory and practice could meet.
%The theory of {\em{sparsity}} studies abstract notions of uniform sparsity for classes of graphs, as well as more general logical structures.
%The main goal of the theory is to understand why, and to what extent, sparsity of a given structure can be used to describe its properties, 
%and to develop tools helpful for designing sparsity-based methods.
%Since the work of Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il and Ossona de Mendez, who laid solid foundations of the theory in the late 2000's, 
%a huge body of work has shown that the two main notions --- {\em{bounded expansion}} and {\em{nowhere denseness}} ---
%have deep connections with classic concepts from combinatorics, model theory, and algorithm design, and can be used to obtain new, powerful results in these areas.
%It is the synergy of these three fields that makes sparsity a mathematically rich and exciting theory, which is currently under rapid development.
%The notions of bounded expansion and nowhere denseness also constitute borders of computational tractability for natural classes of problems, 
%most notably for the model-checking problem for first-order logic; this witnesses the fundamental nature of the studied concepts.
