\paragraph*{Structure of the seminar.}
We intend to keep the seminar oriented on research and collaboration.
A block of talks will be scheduled each morning, while afternoons will be kept free for collaboration.
The talks will be a mix of invited tutorials on important techniques,
keynote lectures on recent developments, and shorter contributed talks.
We intend to prioritize early career researchers for giving contributed talks and
we will make sure that they take an active part in the afternoon discussions,
including encouraging them to organize working groups on topics discussed during the workshop.
To guarantee the collaborative atmosphere and to assist with identifying hot topic problems to be discussed,
we plan to organize an open problems session in the early afternoon of the first day.
To facilitate a smooth and lively interaction during the problem session,
we will contact several key participants beforehand and ask them to prepare open problems to present.
If needed, a second open problem session or a progress report session will be held later during the week.
