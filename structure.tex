\paragraph*{Structure of the seminar.}
We would like to keep the seminar oriented on research and collaboration, and therefore leave the participants plenty of time for working together.
A block of talks will be scheduled each morning, while afternoons will be kept free for collaboration.
The scientific program will be a mix of invited tutorials on important techniques, keynote lectures on recent developments, and shorter contributed talks on topics suggested by the organizers.
On the afternoon of the first day we plan an open problems session; we also would like to contact several key participants beforehand and ask them to prepare some concrete open problems.
If needed, a second open problem session will be held later during the week.
