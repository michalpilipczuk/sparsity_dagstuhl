\paragraph*{Introduction.}

We may like to say that sparsity is viewed differently by researchers with different backgrounds and
we can then present the views. This will unify the text. It seemed to be as rather four independent parts and
we have not been sending a unifying message in my view. \emph{Written by DK.}

My biggest issue with the text at the moment is that it's not forward-looking, and doesn't emphasize what would be valuable
about bringing people from these communities together. That is, what's wrong with just letting this continue to be a
productive line of research in each of these communities? Why would a Dagstuhl be beneficial? The individual views
seem to hide the potential for advancement through interaction or collaboration.  \emph{Written by BDS.}
