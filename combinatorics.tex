%Graph classes with restricted structure (such as minor closed classes) and classes based on various notions of width
%play an important role in algorithm design.  Classical results from the theory of graph minors have recently been
%extended to more general classes of graphs, e.g. those avoiding immersions and subdivisions, which provided new insights
%on their structure including the existence of small-size separators.  The introduction of graph classes with bounded
%expansion and nowhere-dense classes has led to a new robust way of understanding sparsity with many implications
%in combinatorics and computer science.  An important direction seeks to transfer methods from the study of sparse
%classes to non-sparse classes, such as graphs of bounded clique-width and their generalisations.
