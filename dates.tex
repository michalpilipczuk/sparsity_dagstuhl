We would be most happy to organize the seminar either in Autumn 2019 or in Spring 2020. The following blocks of dates would be most suitable:
\begin{itemize}
\item 30.09.2019 --- 15.11.2019;
\item 02.03.2020 --- 03.04.2020;
\item 20.04.2020 --- 24.04.2020.
\end{itemize}
As for block-out dates, the following weeks should be excluded from consideration:
\begin{itemize}
\item 10.09.2019 --- 14.09.2019.
\end{itemize}
